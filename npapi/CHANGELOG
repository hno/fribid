2010-10-03 Henrik Nordström:

  * Upgraded to newer and better isolated header files from
    mozilla xulrunnner 1.9.2.10 as-is without any changes.
  * Trivial #include changes in C files to match new headers

2009-11-13. Changed by Samuel Lidén Borell:

  * Added a dummy function for compatibility with Opera
  * Changed the syntax mode in the header to C, and changed
    the indentation to 4 spaces.
  * Disabled Java support (didn't compile and wasn't needed)
